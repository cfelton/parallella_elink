# Parallella Epiphany Link (elink)
Work In Progress, check back later (01-May-2015) or delete.

Parallella *elink* design verification (DV) and alternate 
implementation.  The alternative implementation to provide
a flexible *elink* core that can easily be tailored for a
specific usage.

The *elink* is the conduit between the FPGA and the 
[Adapteva Ephiphany processor](http://www.adapteva.com/epiphanyiii/).
This core in mainly used on the 
[parallella board](http://www.parallella.org/board/) but
the implementation is flexible enough to be used on any 
FPGA (or ASIC).

**Note**: this core will, more than likely, be moved to 
the [~~`mn`~~ `rhea` repository](http://www.github.com/cfelton/minnesota) in
the near future.
